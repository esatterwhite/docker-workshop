Containers
==========
Containers provide process ioslation and resource management. The anology of shipping containers is often used to describe
their common use case in development circles. Everything you need to run your application goes into a container, and you ship
the container.

With Docker, a container is created from an image( *template* ) using the `run` command, similar to using an ISO to create
a new computer environment. The environment inside the container only know what you tell it.
